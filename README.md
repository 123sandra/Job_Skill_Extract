# Job_Skill_Extract🤖 📝
__This app analyzes job descriptions to identify and extract technical and soft skills,__ helping job seekers👩‍🎓🧑‍🎓 tailor their resumes or recruiters understand role requirements🧐. Built as an interactive web application💻, it processes user-input text📄 or sample job postings from a dataset📋, delivering a clean list of skills 📃🎇 <br>
✅Identifies skills from a comprehensive list of over 80 technical and soft skills using a rule-based NLP approach 🧐🕵️ <br>
✅Allows users to enter custom job descriptions via a text area and extract skills with a single click 👩‍💻👨‍💻<br>

__🦋 How It Works__ <br>
☑️ Takes a job description (e.g., "Need someone with Python, AI, and teamwork skills"). <br>
☑️ Uses NLTK for tokenization and stopword removal, with custom logic to detect both single-word (e.g., "Python") and multi-word skills (e.g., "deep learning"). <br>
☑️ Returns a list of matched skills from the predefined skills_list, displayed in the app.<br>

📑Here i have used NLTK nlp libraries for tokenization, remove stopwords etc. I created UI with the help of Streamlit framework👩‍💻 in PyCharm IDE.<br>

Here is the streamlit app Check it out!🎆:
